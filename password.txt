the stuff here may make or break your computer, so I decided to lay out a blueprint here

first you MUST install this

sudo apt-get -y install libpam-cracklib


for the /etc/pam.d/common-password

do this:

Add “remember=5” to the end of the line that has
“pam_unix.so” in it.

Add “minlen=8” to the end of the line that has
“pam_unix.so” in it

Add “ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1” to the end of the line with “pam_cracklib.so” in it.**




for the /etc/login.defs

do this:

Maximum Password Duration:
• PASS_MAX_DAYS 90
‐ Minimum Password Duration:
• PASS_MIN_DAYS 10
‐ Days Before Expiration to Warn Users
to Change Their Password:
• PASS_WARN_AGE 7


for the /etc/pam.d/common-auth

do this:

auth required pam_tally2.so deny=5 onerr=fail unlock_time=1800

NOTE: Run ts last cuz it MAY screw up your system

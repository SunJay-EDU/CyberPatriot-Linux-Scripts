Honestly, theres no way or a reliable way to make a script for finding files as it could vary A LOT, but here are some general tips.

Heres how to generaly remove bad applications:

sudo apt remove <app>
sudo apt purge <app>
sudo apt-get autoremove -y









finding files that are commonly banned:


for suffix in mp3 txt wav wma aac mp4 mov avi gif jpg png bmp img exe msi bat sh
do
  sudo find /home -name *.$suffix
done


(save and run as a .sh file pls...)








If you want to find malware or such backdoors, clamAV is useless because the school wifi somehow messes up (go dragons!...)

you finna have to find it manually with this:


find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null > /root/suid_files.txt


(run as root...)


you can find hidden files with this (hidden directory finder below)

find / -type f -name ".*" 2>/dev/null > /root/hidden_files.txt

find / -type d -name ".*" 2>/dev/null > /root/hidden_dirs.txt

find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null > /root/suid_files.txt

find / -uid +999 2>/dev/null

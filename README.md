# CyberPatriot-Linux-Scripts
Making standalone scripts for system hardening for Linux


The "general script" does the core items that will gurantee you points
I seperated the other tasks as their own scripts for simplicity

In order to run these, you can either download them or copy/paste them into a text editor (on the VM), and add the necessary permissions to run them

Cyberpatriot Linux Checklist:

NOTE: These are general tips and may vary between Ubuntu and Linux Mint

Introduction:
	Unique ID (Enter it)

Forensic Questions:
	Forensics Questions (Usually only two of them)	
	NOTE: Do NOT delete anything before doing the FQs, some of the questions could rely on said deleted items. Also once you are 100% DONE with the FQs, then you can delete them as they give free points.


ReadME:
	The ReadME is very important as it contains steps that you must do for points.
	DO NOT disable or alter things under critical service(s)


System Hardening:
	This step will take the longest as it contains multiple steps…

	Users & Groups:

		In both Ubuntu and Mint, there are Users & Group Management programs (Always system installed ones). Use that for this part..
		This step is quite tedious but easy!...

		Use the checklist you are provided as it contains the list of Admins and authorized users
		If a user is marked with Admin -> select Adminstator User/Mode
		If a user is marked with authorized user -> select Desktop/Standard  User/Mode
		If a user is not found in both sections -> Delete their account & Files

		In this step, if you find that an admin has a weak password (all lowercase letters no numbers or special characters). Then change out their password to something better such as this: $udoT1gerMan6767

	In the ReadME, you may have been instructed to add a user. If so, do it now.
	In the ReadME, you may have been asked to make sure a user changes their password next time they log in. Down below will tell you how to do that! (This command works for BOTH Linux Distros)

COMMAND: sudo passwd -e [name of user]
ALT. COMMAND: sudo chage -d 0 [name of user]


Updates:

	After you have finished the Users/Groups step, run updates through these commands!

COMMAND 1: sudo apt update 	(select y when prompted to)
COMMAND 2: sudo apt upgrade	(select y when prompted to)

	USUALLY this is supposed to be a one-time thing and should earn you points
	Run those commands every now and then to ensure you are fully updated since SOMETIMES it acts up (Just ask one of us…)
	Usually, you will know it worked once the scoreboard reports back with:

	“ [Random Application] Updated + 5pts “
	“ [Security Patches] Installed + 10 pts “

	If the ReadME specified to update everything else except for [random] package, heres the command to do that

	Sudo apt-mark hold [package name]
	Then run apt update and upgrade

	

	After running those updates, we must now enable auto updates too as it earns your points.

Ubuntu: 
	Desktop Menu -> Software & Updates -> Updates tab -> Select the option to enable auto updates and click the 2 buttons that specify security stuff

Mint:
	Update manager -> options (select the “refresh the list of updates…” option) -> automation (select all check mark stuff)
	

Next we can go to removing “banned” applications and files
These apps are (usually) hacking tools such as Wireshark, ophcrack, or some pirating software. Games are also not allowed to be installed.
Also as a general rule of thumb any MP3/MP4 files are usually prohibited unless specified

Deleting banned files is straightforward (Use the File GUI, navigate through common directories and delete them)
OR, you can use copy and paste this and make it into a script:

for suffix in mp3 txt wav wma aac mp4 mov avi gif jpg png bmp img exe msi bat sh
do
  sudo find /home -name *.$suffix
done
